		    							Since cancer is a genomic disease there is a need to analyze and understand the underlying omics data.

		    						<li>The ability to make correlations between different attributes from the results of the analysis will complement steps that are being taken to cure cancers.</li>
		    						<li>LinkedOmics is a tool suite for connecting genomic, proteomic and clinical attributes.</li>

		    					<ul>
		    						<li>
		    							Two members of the LinkedOmics suite, <em>LinkFinder</em> and <em>LinkCompare</em>, conduct the LinkedOmics association analysis.
		    						</li>
		    						<li>
		    							LinkViz helps to visualize correlations between two attributes after the analysis has been done by LinkFinder. The results of the analysis by the LinkFinder can be either continuous, binary or survival data.
		    						</li>
		    						<li>
		    							LinkCompare can be used to make correlations between multiple attributes based on the results of the analysis by LinkFinder.

	    					<p id="subheading">
		    					Visiomics was developed mainly with the D3 Javascript library and the R programming lanuage. Among the different charts generated by Visiomics are scatterplots, boxplots, venn diagrams, heatmaps and Kaplan-Meier graphs.
		    					<ul>
		    						<li>
		    							<em>Scatterplots</em>: To visualize the relationship between two continuous attributes.
		    						</li>
		    						<li>
		    							<em>Boxplots</em>: To visualize the correlations between classified attributes. For example, a box plot may be used to compare the simlarities and differences in the expression of a normal gene and a mutatnt gene.
		    						</li>
		    						<li>
		    							<em>Venn Diagrams</em>: To visualize how many attributes are shared in two different groups. For instance, one can measure how many patients share a common mutation versus how many do not.
		    						</li>
		    						<li>
		    							<em>Heatmaps</em>: To communicate the relationships between data values using colors.
		    						</li>
		    						<li>
		    							<em>Kaplan-Meier Graphs</em>: To track an event over time. The event can anything including employment, cure, marriage and admissions. In our case, the event is "death".

	    					<h4 id="subheading"><u><strong>Usage</strong></u></h4>
	    					<p id="subheading">
		    					To use Visiomics, one should have the results of their association analysis  saved in a text document. A visual format of the analysis results (by either LinkFinder or LinkCompare) can be generated with the corresponding Visiomics functionality.
